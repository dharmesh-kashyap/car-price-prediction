## About
Sometimes, we all need help to get around. Whether you're trying to find your way around a new city or just looking for a new car, sometimes you need a little help from the machine.

So what if we told you that there's some really cool stuff going on with car pricing right now?

Price prediction is a difficult problem. If you're buying a car, you want it to be within your budget, and you don't want to be taken advantage of by the dealer. A machine learning model (a statistical model) is able to make predictions based on past data.

There are many ways to predict prices, but one of the simplest is using a linear regression model. This model takes all of your prices and compares them with other cars that have similar features. The result is a predicted price based on those features. You can then compare that prediction with the actual price of similar cars in your area to see if it's accurate‚Äîand if not, how much more or less expensive it should be given its predicted value.
